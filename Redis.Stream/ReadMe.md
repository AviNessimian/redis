# Stream
Streams in Redis are first released in version 5. 
The streams in Redis is similar to Kafka. 

Multiple consumers can read the same stream at a different point in time.
Whereas producers will continuously produce data into the stream. 
It also has a concept of consumer groups like Kafka, 
where different consumers from a consumer group can read different parts of the stream.
