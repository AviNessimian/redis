# Redis

## We can use it as a:
1. distributed in-memory cache
2. pub/sub messaging engine
3. streaming engine (more recently)


## redis-cli 
We can use the redis-cli for running any commands. 
It is a very handy tool to verify if the installation went all. 
Also, it can help debug issues which sometimes might be hard to debug through client APIs.

Command To Use Redis CLI
'docker exec -it redis redis-cli'
